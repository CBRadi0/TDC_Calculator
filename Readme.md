The Angle on Bow function is a bit funky. It does work, you just have to use it in the specified manner.

1. You must be on the same course heading as the enemy.
2. Aim the Periscope at the enemy ship and note the Relative Bearing to the enemy.
3. Input that data into the Angle on Bow section of the calculator.
4. It will not give you Port or Starboard you will have to manually set.

Happy Hunting,
